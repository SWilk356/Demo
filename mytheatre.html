                    The first thing to know about Ba Sing Se is the city's layout. The city is surrounded by sections of the city in the following
                    order, from the outermost section to the innermost:
                </p>

                                    <li><strong>Outer Wall: </strong>The outermost line of defense for Ba Sing Se. It encircles the entire city, including the Agrarian Zone.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Agrarian Zone: </strong>This penultimate section provides for the entire city, making Ba Sing Se completely self-sufficient!</li>
                                    <li><strong>Inner Wall: </strong>This wall encircles the residential districts of the city, providing its residents an extra line of defense.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lower Ring: </strong>This section is comprised of the city's poorest residents. Lower Ring residents must have a passport to enter the Upper Ring.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Middle Ring: </strong>This section is comprised of the city's middle class. Middle Ring residents may travel wherever they like in the city without a need for a passport.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Upper Ring: </strong>This section is comprised of the city's richest residents. Upper Ring residents are upper-class citizens, often having ties to the government. They also do not need a passport to travel anywhere in the city.</li>

                                        This hidden gem is not a sight to miss. Many people will not travel to the Lower Ring because of its poor reputation, but the Firelight Fountain is
                                        a rare kind of beauty not found in the higher rings. Go at night to see the fountain in full effect!
